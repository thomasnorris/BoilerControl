## Notes
- This project takes the [relay project](https://github.com/thomasnorris/RPi3-BlynkTriggerRelay) and further modifies it do do other things. Specific instructions are not provided. This switches gears all the time so will probably not be of any use to anyone but myself.
- Clone with this command:
  - `sudo git clone https://github.com/thomasnorris/RPi3-BlynkSandbox.git && cd RPi3-BlynkSandbox/bin && chmod +x install.sh`
- Run the install script:
  - `./install.sh`
